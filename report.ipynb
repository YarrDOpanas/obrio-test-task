I'm usually not one of those swear by astrology sign type of people but this app really describes what I am going through most of the time and it gives you positive hope. And I even once had an appointment with an astrologer who was supposed to help me solve some of my personal issues, and that was of course a different experience. But for those who haven’t seen real astrologers, this app is the closest to it I’ve ever seen And I can tell you for sure that with the help of the stars you can find out the most important numbers in your life, which tattoo should people of your sign do, when is the best moon for a new haircut, and a lot more. And this app is great about it, it gives you so many tips from different parts of your life, that with the personal astrologer you’d have to pay a fortune for that! So this app ain’t be cheap, but the price for this detailed info is more than acceptable. But that’s only for people who care about real astrology, for those who should just read some random predictions, framed as your horoscope - go on with free apps. I don’t believe there would be people doing so much work to prepare horoscopes for free. So I definitely recommend this app to anyone I know who is at least a bit interested in astrology, thank you for making this app so great!\",\n",

And if you are so curious as I am you may sometimes read your horoscope for tomorrow, but I don’t recommend to do that. I prefer to read my horoscope in the evening, to analyze the whole day and to remember the details which my daily horoscope describes, it’s like you summarize your day and remember everything the most significant from it. Another way to have fun is that you can learn for instance how Moon in Libra, that is ending already, influences your life. You can learn that from astrology course inside an app.. And then you can discover what actually happens in your life and see this huge connection! Or you can learn about previous month and analyze it as well! And then you will be able to plan some important events by yourself, taking into account the planetary movement, you will choose the right time for some changes and for big decisions. Or you can just go for personal reading from astrologist, but this is more exciting for me. And so on, and so forth, I can actually tell a lot about this app. But you’d better try yourself. I highly recommend this app... The theme, the colors, daily reminder, and much more... Thank you for this app I rate it as 5 stars!!!',\n",

It really makes me happy with all their caring notifications and so much interesting things to read in the app! I like the “Learn” section and the “Relationships”H section too. It’s just that every time I can’t wait to get access for the new lessons! This is so exciting and intriguing, I am studying astrology with an excitement like I am playing a game. And that is definitely a great way to study! However the love compatibility option needs to have gender options as masculine and feminine vibrations effect compatibility a lot! And that is not just about love compatibility, but also work, family, friendship, any relationship you may have with another person actually. Add gender options male female nonbinary and maybe a masculine/feminine chart for the non binary folks out there. Please consider this! This is actually really important right now. But as far as I know noone has actually done something like that, at least none of those apps that I’ve used before, and I am telling you this because I really like your app. And all the other features are absolutely great, that is the only thing I wanted you to consider. So think about it, if you do it your app will definitely be #1 among all the horoscope apps. So just keep rocking!',\n",

Some do not directly answer your questions and lead you with questions they offer.  I had the same woman for several weeks and she made stuff up in details to prolong the chat session.  It called her out on it and then there was a long pause.  Stopped with that one and moved on to another. You have to watch because they hire people that come from backgrounds in counseling. I asked for mediumship/psychic read and that is ne kept reverting to tarot.  A few didnt speak  English very well and it was hard to understand what they were trying to say.  (Broken English) they don’t screen them very well.  I ended up trying one more that was very good.  Didn’t offer any info she was unsure of.  Finally someone that didn’t B.S. me.  Their app is antiquated chat rooms. Can’t copy/paste or any basic or advanced features .  They would do well to actually test them before some of these folks are hired.

This app has crumbled to pieces because they’ve been blinded by greed. I’ve used them for years for simple things like my birth chart and daily horoscope and the community but I knew this would happen when they started with the “ads to see match” and then took that away to begin charging for the “ideal partner” match compatibility feature. And slowly but surely everything started becoming unavailable unless subscribed. Now their charging to see a full birth chart. So they take our information put it in their database (to no doubt sell to other companies to scam or contact you without permission) and then make practically all areas in the app inaccessible unless you pay a ridiculous amount in subscriptions. Newsflash Nebula, you shot yourselves in the foot. And asking for more money (consistently) or saying you will “reduce the price” for a certain amount of time is just absurd and offensive. For what this app provides in “services” the cost is totally out of proportion and shows just how deluded pricing has gotten. This app is only interested in taking your money. And the “psychics” for the most part seem AI generated or illegible, but I don’t dabble in that enough to care. I’ll be uninstalling and will be actively telling people to avoid this app. It really is a shame, this app was such a great asset.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This app is very well made, and it is great for the daily horoscope and other information like your birth charts and much more information about you. However, I feel as if the prices for the readings are rooted in greed, and the paywall would be best for those making $100,000 per year or more. You get 3 minutes for free then every minute is 30-60 pts. 10 points is the equivalent of $1. So a ten minute conversation by text will cost you roughly $30. Not to mention the reading people will be on and off the conversation sometimes so you are occasionally paying while they are talking to someone else. This is definitely a critical issue. They need to rearrange the app to where you can schedule a 15ish minute reading for a reasonable price and have the reader exclusively. Some readers go up to 60 pts or $6 dollars a minute. I have local readings at a place that charges about $70 for 30 minutes. So I certainly feel like the prices on the app are quite excessive in my opinion. They are also basically sales people as random readers text me in the app every day to chat with them for money per minute. Decent app but a minute goes by instantly and it can take 2 minutes for them to even respond or look at your question.',\n",

But every single update takes me one step closer to deleting the app forever. I hate the app now. It’s not cute, it’s not even fun anymore, it’s just ads. You give us one super vague annoying horoscope and that’s it, everything else is an ad. There used to be soo many fun features on this app that you guys have decided to take away. There’s no longer the moon phases and planets current location explanations like there used to me, or a few words at the top explaining what your focus of the day is, and if you want to look at your actual birth chart it’s impossible bc of all the ads you have to watch. Seriously rethink whatever team you have working on this app at the moment because you’re about to lose a lot of your “fans” to an app like co-star who instead of taking things away from us, is constantly adding new features',\n",

But here’s the kicker: it initially tells you what the actual price is but if you can’t afford that, it gives you other prices you could pay including $1. I chose the $1 option because I couldn’t afford to pay full price nor do I want to before I’ve even seen the results. I ultimately decided the app wasn’t worth it so I deleted it. Well, a few days later I got a notification from my bank about this very app trying to charge me $45. So I blocked the charge and redownloaded the app and had to play around in settings for 10 minutes before I found the “how to check for active subscriptions” button  and entered in my email and discovered that the app had, in fact, signed me up for a subscription that I didn’t want. And it wasn’t even premium! I still had the option to sign up for premium because I didn’t have it. So what the h**l is the $45 for?',\n",

I contacted support to cancel they send you a bot to try to talk too.

It set off a fraud alert on my card and had to cancel it. I won’t have access to my bank account for over a week now until I get a new card. The customer service I finally did talk to were extremely rude and unhelpful. Saying that by taking any quiz you agreed to a 45 dollar charge and failed to cancel. Again sent me links to cancel, which I had already tried to do on my own the day I downloaded. There was in fact later a message saying I couldn’t cancel until my subscription was active. It wasn’t active until they sneak in the 45 dollar charge. This company is deceptive. I reported them fraudulent. I called Apple to deal with it and they had no proof I signed up for this subscription through Apple Pay. If I could give 0 stars I would. This is absolutely a scam. The “psychic” I messaged to cancel said they are sorry and paid so they have nothing to do with the app. TLDR: BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS APP IT CHARGES YOU FOR EVERYTHING WITHOUT WARNING AND YOU CANNOT CANCEL UNTIL THEY GET MULTIPLE CHARGES OF 45 DOLLARS FROM YOU.',\n",

I definitely listed my birthday correctly. I don’t understand why it would categorize me as a Leo, when even in the app it begins Virgo on the 23rd? Is it a fluke? If you’re going to categorize me as a Leo, then at least change the dates you categorize with so there is at least an explanation. Don’t categorize me as a Leo, but then say Virgos start on the 23rd when you won’t even categorize me as a Virgo. \\n\\nAs for the app itself. The daily horoscopes are nice and even though it categorized me as a Leo instead of a Virgo, I was happy that I could still view the Virgo horoscope. As for the other features, you would have to pay to get anything else out of the app. Yes you get a free compatibility report, just one, if you wanted to try another you’d have to subscribe and pay. \\n\\nHonestly, I wish I could get past the Leo/Virgo issue I had, but it really bothers me and I think I’m going to have to delete the app. Please update your dates or fix the issue of having August 23rd-ers categorized as Leos when even in the app it says August 23rd is a Virgo.',\n",

Then had to deal with getting my money back in which of course it can be taken in seconds but getting it back is a diff story. Customer service is fine. As you can see on other complaints they will comment things are “clearly stated” however upon talking to customer service on insta having them admit to the app switching the choice to the 50 dollar option bc it’s “preferred” is an issue … there should be no switching from the persons original choice of the free trial etc right before the person moves forward. This is a clear trick and needs to be fixed if this isn’t unintentional… however I can imagine getting close to 50 bucks from multiple users wouldn’t be turned down regardless. In the end if you have the money floating for this app I guess it could be fun, but in todays world clarity and ease is what makes a strong app long term. I’m glad other ppl are enjoying it though.\\n\\nUPDATE: The response to this review is the perfect example of what is going on here, no accountability, no real solution.

What’s next? Support support you support them support everybody. How about if someone wants to hear political position on stuff will ask for it. I’ll tune into a channel and specifically seek it out or bottom line. It’s just such a letdown. There’s not one element of the app that’s worthy of praise.

I think you should have a notification box set-up to make it easier to see responses to your comments and comments on your post. I also think you should be able to click on someone’s profile and see their other posts. Finally, I think you should be able to search (by key word) for people and posts.

So, if your a bit tight on funds, there’s still an option to educate yourself! \\n\\nI love the fact of when you are setting the app up to your customization, it asks more than just your name and birth date, with the little bit of extra information you provide of what time you were born and where, it is able to open up so much more of your personal chart. I’ve learned quite a few new things about myself with this app that I didn’t realize before and I’ve been going through the lessons to learn more about them all. I am a practicing Wiccan, so a lot of this is already known by me, but there’s always more to learn. \\n\\nI highly recommend this app. If you were debating, just download it and try it out for yourself. After filling in your information it will ask if you’d like to pay for a vip trial or have a few days of a free trial, you can bypass that and continue to use the app, which is also an amazing thing, because usually with these apps, you can’t do that. \\n\\nJust try it out!

For example, let’s say today my horoscope told me I was going to encounter a loss of money by trusting someone, it’ll actually happen 3 days later or so. Sometimes it’s the other way around, sometimes it actually happens 3 days before it tells me. LOL maybe I’m delulu but anyways one thing that does bother me though is how mixed message it is. My horoscope will tell me to “make sure not to make any important decision on this day” and then my tarot card will tell me to go “make an important decision today or I’ll regret it in the future”. It confuses me a lot😂like who do I listen to? Of course, I do what I want and what my gut tells me but it just shows how the message isn’t clear or maybe someone isn’t proofreading before posting.

I dealt with the ads for the weekly/monthly/yearly subscription and wasn’t too annoyed. Fast forward to now… I can’t even read my birth chart without paying? Honestly, that was the main reason I used the app. Requiring a subscription to view this information is quite frankly ludicrous. I loved the way the app looks, it’s aesthetically pleasing and has a lot of neat features! But, the developer’s greed has pretty much rendered it unusable unless you want to dish out your money. Incredibly disappointing. I understand needing money to pay the staff/team that keeps your app afloat but there has got to be other ways than to milk every possible avenue for monetary gain. I would much rather make a one time purchase of a paid application like “Nebula: Complete” for $10-$15 so there’s no recurrent fees.

As mentioned this app was enjoyable and consideration to become a member would have easily lean in the affirmative, yet one particular ad was presented, closed and presented again like five seconds later, closed in an effort to glean the insight that I was accustomed to understanding daily and before the sentence content could be determined the ad reappeared again, a different ad may have been less frustrating, but the same ad like a dozen times in a row, no shirt, was frustratingly annoying enough to compel me to share my encounter with the strange uncle and the bad touches I felt.

After seeing an ad for the app I thought, “WTH why not give it a shot.” When it comes down to it this app has a lot of work to do to not only for convenience but also functionally. \\n\\nAfter downloading the app the first thing that rubbed me wrong was the amount of times I was asked to subscribe (sign-up for a membership). The first time I was prompted I didn’t know it was optional until I noticed the X (close button) in the top right corner. However, after closing the subscription screen I was prompted several more times to subscribe in order to do almost anything on the app. The basic functions of the app are horoscopes and your personal birth chart, which are free. These can pretty much be found on ANY website for free and are just as accurate if not better on other websites.  \\n\\nSecondly, I noticed that I accidentally put in the wrong birth time. When trying to correct this mistake I realized that there was no way to correct it or at the very least it is very difficult to find.\\n\\nOverall, in my opinion this app is not worth the time nor amount of $$$ for the features. The only thing I like about this app is the features it has such as the palmistry, however, you need to subscribe for $119 (annual) or 9.99 (monthly) to be able to access many or these features.',\n",

Now when I try to check my birth chart, it goes straight to me having to pay for a subscription in which all of these years of having Nebula I never dealt with before. But lately I’ve been realizing that Nebula has been removing access to almost all of their stuff in their app in order for users to pay for the subscription which is actually messed up because if that’s the case, why have the app free to download but not free to explore anything? 😂 I personally say it’s a waste of time to get this app nowadays because you can easily pull up your birth chart on different websites than nebula that would charge you to breathe on their app 🎉😂😂',\n",

It's asking to pay a price to unlock them?? \\n\\nI'm not sure why these apps think they're so special, I can simply go on Google and look up my placements but I just enjoyed the little tips and tricks, and guidance that nebula would offer but im sure now because they want more profit they're charging some perks of the app? \\n\\nI let it slide back then when you had to all of a sudden pay to see your horoscope for the next few days, it would ask for either payment or to watch a video and I never paid mind to it.

And it also felt like I gained a not insignificant amount of insights into myself and others from using it. It was great to have at gatherings with family and friends. It’s so disappointing now.

I used this service once and was happy with the answer and speaking to someone however I will use the service again on my own accord, not when it’s advertised to me three times a day. In fact— it makes me less likely to use it again when there’s so many notifs.

Every time you want to unlock something (like palm reading) you have to watch an ad. After you watch the ad and exist the “notes” (section of palm reading) it will be locked once again. So what I’m saying is that if you unlock something by watching ads it will lock once you leave the page. You can easily find the information on your sign on another app without watching the ads over and over again. The only way I see this app different than the others are the shop/store, but every time I open the store it opens up my settings for some reason.',\n",

Since downloading the Nebula app I’ve become a believer. I’ve had very specific events reflected with unnerving precision in my daily horoscopes as well as practical advice and observations that are perhaps mundane but incredibly insightful nonetheless, (“you’ve developed a habit of eating sugary snacks late in the evening; this is terrible for the health of your teeth.” Umm, yes; I had developed that habit and the point was certainly appreciated.)

I was so upset, i tried contacting them so i wrote them a email but they did not respond! So eventually i decided to leave a review. Also the way their texting with astrologists work is horrible, you get a limited amount of points and get a large amount of points taken away just for sending one text even if it is a “Thank you”. I had wrote a paragraph explaining my situation and asking for advise to 3 astrologists ( which only 2 answered) and they answered by asking me another question… i feel like this was done on purpose so i can waste my points!

The response I got from this person was the complete opposite of my Vedic readings and my other western readings that have been 100% accurate from the 2018 to present events in my life...\\n\\nUpdating my comment based on response by Obrio Limited. Let me clarify what I meant. You can claim and say Astrology is not a science all you want but I am a firm believer of the stars and planets. Reading the stars and planet movements was considered science from many ancient civilizations and have predicted many things. In other words, I don’t doubt Astrology, your readers are either not that great or not very enthusiastic working for your platform... Since the last reading, I got another one done from a different astrologer on your app. Although he was a little better, still both were very lacking...

So, if the advisor responds slowly, you will lose money. So far, one of the advisors is very prompt in responding. However, you need to make sure that you reach out to them while they are online. The site does give you an option of texting the advisor while they are offline and reportedly will respond to you when they are online again. The issue is that if they respond and you aren’t available, they use up all your credits because the timer starts once they respond. I’ve lost 200 credits because one of the advisors responded when I wasn’t near my phone and she let the timer run. I wasted all my credits for her to ask me “I need a first name”.

I’m not impressed with the information I’m being given that is not available through other places. You’ve offered me no additional insight about myself, my compatibility, my planets, etc, that I didn’t already know. \\nThird- I wanted the relationship info. It said the report would be ready.

I do think that it is way too expensive for premium, however it’s a pretty cool app. Honestly love everything about it, especially the haircut calendar. That is something unique that I’ve never seen on a horoscope app before. This is my favorite feature, but it’s been missing for the the new year. I’ve given it a couple days, hoping that it will show up. I even tried the free trail, looking to see if it was a premium thing (which I would/could never stomach paying that much)... which I’m really hoping that it’s not. Is there something wrong with it? Will it be released for the new year? Please let me know! Please don’t get rid of it! Please keep it as a free feature, it will draw a lot more customers!',\n",

This was one of my beloved apps that i used for astrology they changed the whole interface, they removed masculine, and feminine energies which made this app unique that they told you if you were more dominant, and either one. That was one of my favorite features about this app specifically then they decided to remove the moon cycle and what phase the moon is in which again is another feature that I really loved about this app. These features are what made this app different than the others. And now it just looks so generic and it’s so disappointing. Please bring back these features. I know I’m not the only one that loved how unique this app used to be.',\n",

Anyways, you should read all of the One Star reviews if you’re thinking about getting this app—-there’s quite a few of them, and they are ALL about how THIS APP STEALS MONEY!! I got it and opted for the three days trial and instantly disliked it. It was nowhere near to accurate. When I tried to get out of the free trial it wouldn’t let me. There’s literally NO SETTINGS on this app, so I had no idea how to unsubscribe, I even tried deleting the app from my phone, by this time it had already charged me. I had to look online for like twenty minutes before I could figure out how to unsubscribe. By then I’d already been charged. Again. I unsubscribed AND IM STILL GETTING CHARGED FOR IT!!!!!!! I don’t even have the app anymore!!! You’d think after so many bad reviews the creators would have done something. Why haven’t they? Because they’re getting free money.',\n",

Anyways there should be at least an other choice or maybe custom option. Also as afab (a female at birth I put female bc I just wanted to try the app) when there is mentioning of relationships it was assumed as he bc I put female. Just so ya know creators not everyone likes the opposite gender. To solve this you could use they/them bc it is neutral. Although this could be very small to some people making it normalized on the most random apps are playing a part in something that is natural. If you don’t think it is natural ask yourself what’s the definition of natural? Then use google and look up homosexual behaviors in other species.',\n",
